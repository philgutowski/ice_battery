A tool for calculating all the properties for custom cold plates to be installed with a marine refrigeration system.

## Steps

### Calculate Heat Leak of Insulated Box
	By determining the heat losses from any particular box, we can therefore determine its refrigeration requirements.  This assumes a well constructed box with no air leaks, the use of closed cell foam insulation, and a top-opening lid.

1. Calculate outside area of box.
2. Determine thickness of insulation, and fridge or freezer application.
3. Select fridge or freezer option.
2. Reference data object for heat loss vs. thickness of insulation.
